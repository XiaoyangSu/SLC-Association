This is the script calculating the correlations between SLC gene expression levels and the cellular metabolite levels.
The input metabolomics data file is "CCLE_metabolomics_20190502.csv"
The input transcriptomic data file is "Expression_RPKM.csv", which is unzipped from CCLE_RNAseq_genes_rpkm_20180929.gct.gz
Both the metabolomic and the transcriptomic input datasets are from CCLE, as described in our manuscript.
